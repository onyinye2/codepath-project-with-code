2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Time was really a challenge for me while creating this submission. I started my submission during spring break. I was studying, catching up on work, and planning a family event. However, after attending the virtual information session on March 16th, I knew that I had to get my application in. Still, even after break I had exams, a speech to give, and just regular college student things. I was feeling pressure because I only finished the basic implementation of the game, and I still had much more to do before I submit. I was also really confused watching the videos on how to set up GitHub and README file. I was beating myself up for not doing everything fast enough. However, I think I did great considering my circumstances. I didn't fail my exams, I got my speech in on time, I haven't missed any of my dance practices, I still show up to work, I am still in the process of building a website for my UI/UX workshop, and I am almost done with my CodePath Prework. Nothing suffered just because I had a lot on my plate. So, I really understood that I can handle more than I think. Usually, when I see a project like this I would count myself out, but I was able to do it and much more. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would like to know what it is like to do web development full-time? There is probably much more to it than what I saw in the project, and I am excited to explore the different distinctions of jobs inside the computer science field. I would also like to learn about the different programming languages used in web development. I see languages like SQL and Node.js in the requirements when I look at internships, and I would like to know how these are utilized in web development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have changed the audio to my buttons and make them play the choruses of songs. One of my favorite artists right now is Rema, so if I had a little more time I would have recorded snippets of the choruses of his songs, like Calm Down, Ginger Me, Woman, and Bounce. Then, I would have had the computer choose a number from 1 - 4, and the corresponding song would play on the buttons. I also would have done more research on html, css, and javascript. This is my first professional project with these languages, so I would have liked to nitpick and go through all the library functions and fields that were provided, but the background provided in directions was very helpful in my understanding.
